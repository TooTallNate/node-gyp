node-gyp
=========
### Node.js native addon build tool

`node-gyp` is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for compiling
native addon modules for Node.js, which takes away the pain of dealing with the
various differences in build platforms.

Multiple target versions of node are supported (i.e. `0.7`, `0.8`, `1.0`, etc.),
even if those versions of node are not installed on your system (`node-gyp`
downloads the necessary development files for the target version).

#### Features:

 * Easy to use, consistent interface
 * Same commands to build your module on every platform
 * Supports multiple target versions of Node


Installation
------------

To install with `npm`, invoke:

``` bash
$ npm install -g node-gyp
```

You will also need to install:

  * On Unix
    * `python`
    * `make`
    * A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like GCC
  * On Windows
    * [Python][windows-python]
    * Microsoft Visual C++ ([Express][msvc] version works well)

How to Use
----------

To compile your native addon, first go to its root directory:

``` bash
$ cd my_node_addon
```

From here, you can invoke the `node-gyp` executable. The next step is to generate
the appropriate project build files for the current platform. Use `configure` for
that:

``` bash
$ node-gyp configure --target=0.7
```

Now you will have either a `Makefile` (on Unix platforms) or a
`vcxproj` file (on Windows) in the current directory. Next invoke the `build`
step:

``` bash
$ node-gyp build
```

Now you have your compiled `.node` bindings file! The compiled bindings end up in
`out/Debug` or `out/Release`, depending on the build mode. At this point you can
require the `.node` file with Node and run your tests!

-------------------

__(Optional)__ Copy the compiled bindings into an appropriate directory for
runtime loading detection (with [node-bindings][]), using the `copy` command:

``` bash
$ node-gyp copy
```

So for example, if you are on a 64-bit OS X machine and your target node version
is `0.7`, then the `copy` command above would copy the bindings from
`out/Release/bindings.node` to `compiled/0.7/darwin/x64/bindings.node`.


Commands
--------

`node-gyp` responds to the following commands:

 * `build` - Invokes `make`/`msbuild.exe` and builds the native addon
 * `clean` - Removes any generated project files and the `out` dir
 * `configure` - Generates project build files for the current platform
 * `copy` - Copies a compiled bindings to an appropriate dir for runtime detection
 * `install` - Installs node development files for the given version
